Ally gave me feedback that the player shouldn't have to rely on text for understanding the inversion mechanic. In that spirit, I added a wavy outline in the opposite color around the player to make sure they knew something was up. I left the text in just in case they struggle, but that's the gist. I also received feedback that I should add enemies and obstacles to make the game more interesting. I did so and I put a custom spin on them using the dimension mechanic.
